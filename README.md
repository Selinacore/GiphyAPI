# GiphyAPI

Attempted to make some gif buttons that grab gifs from the giphy.api.<br>
When you click a button you should get 10 images on the page.<br>
When you add something to the search field it will create a new button and images for the searched item.<br>
If you click on the images you can make them play or pause them.<br>
enjoy!
